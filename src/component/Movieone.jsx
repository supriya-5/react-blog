<p style={{marginLeft:"25px", marginRight:"25px"}}>Parasite (Korean: 기생충; Hanja: 寄生蟲; RR: Gisaengchung) is a 2019 South Korean black comedy thriller film directed by Bong Joon-ho, who co-wrote the screenplay with Han Jin-won. The film, starring Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Jang Hye-jin, and Lee Jung-eun, follows a poor family who scheme to become employed by a wealthy family and infiltrate their household by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.

The script is based on Joon-ho's source material from a play written in 2013. He later adapted it into a fifteen-page film draft, and was split into three different drafts by Jin-won. Joon-ho stated that he took inspiration from the 1960 Korean film The Housemaid, and also from the Christine and Léa Papin incident in the 1930s. Filming began in May 2018 and completed that September. The technical crew comprised cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo, film editor Yang Jin-mo and composer Jung Jae-il. Darcy Paquet, provided English translations for the film's international release.</p>
