<p style={{marginLeft:"25px", marginRight:"25px"}}>The Moonlight Tour at Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the most popular tour programs in South Korea.

A royal palace, which is an indispensable destination for Korean tourism, features distinctly different sentiments between day and night. Tourists flock to the palace during the day to experience a tranquil and relaxed atmosphere. When covered with a veil of darkness, the palace boasts of a different mood. The subtle lighting and mysterious acoustic effects add up different charms. As those attractive features are known through social networking services, royal palaces have recently emerged as new night attractions. 

Among royal palaces that open at night are the four major palaces in Seoul (Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeok Palace, Changgyeong Palace, and Deoksugung Palace) and Hwaseong Haenggung Palace in Suwon. Whether tour programs are available depends on each royal palace, but if it is, reservations must be made on the website.</p>
