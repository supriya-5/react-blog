<p style={{marginLeft:"25px", marginRight:"25px"}}>Often declared the most beautiful Museum in Seoul, the Korea Furniture Museum is a sight that few tourists ever get to visit.

That is because they aren’t open to the general public – you have to make reservations to see it. While it takes a bit more effort, it is well worth your time.

The museum covers over 1.5 acres of impeccably landscaped grounds and consists of 10 wooden hanok buildings. Each of these buildings is designed to recreate a different setting, such as the women’s quarters and a kitchen house or a villa from Changdeokgung.

These scenes are decorated as they would have been during the Joseon Dynasty.

The furniture is exquisite, made from different woods such as maple, paulownia and persimmon, and some of the pieces were donated by the museum director’s own family.

Many are inlaid with tortoise shell, mother of pearl or lacquer. Attention to detail here is amazing; even doorposts and windows are designed with beautiful etchings. The grounds are landscaped in the same fashion, and the scenes out of the windows of the hanoks are simply breathtaking.

Visitors get a personal guided tour, where everything on display is explained and described in such a way that you’ll understand Korean culture, nature, philosophy, and humanity in such a way that you feel like you become a part of it.

It is said that this museum is “perhaps the largest best-kept secret in Seoul.”

That is important to the director of the museum and why they want to keep the visitors to a minimum. They do host some events, including traditional weddings, fashion shows featuring traditional Korean dress and dining evnts showing off Korean cuisine. There is also an exquisite French restaurant where parties of 20 or more people can make reservations. This entire experience is perhaps the best attraction in Seoul.</p>
